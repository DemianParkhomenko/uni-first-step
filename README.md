It is my first step in programming. I know code is not perfect. This repository contains tasks in java. It was one of the first subjects where I learned programming. I remember writing my first 'Hello, World!' program. We copied it from the board, where our teacher had written it in chalk.

Imagine writing something like this when you never see Java code:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

What do private, static, and class mean? Why are there so many braces)) Honestly, it was difficult to write. I got a lot of errors in the terminal then. It was in September 2021.
